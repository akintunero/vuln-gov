A deliberately vulnerable government records management system for security testing and training. This project simulates a government portal with various security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to learn about web security concepts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

This application is **intentionally vulnerable** and should **NEVER** be deployed in a production environment. It is designed for:

* Security research and education
* Penetration testing practice
* Learning about web application security
* Understanding common vulnerabilities

## üéØ Project Purpose

VulnGov is an open-source project that simulates a government portal with various security vulnerabilities. It's designed to help security researchers, developers, and students learn about:

* Common web vulnerabilities
* Security best practices
* Penetration testing techniques
* Secure coding principles

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* npm (v8 or higher)
* Docker (optional)
* MySQL (v8.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akintunero/vuln-gov.git
cd vuln-gov
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your desired configuration
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# Using Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

## üîç Vulnerability Categories

1. **SQL Injection**
   - Location: Search functionality in each ministry
   - Goal: Extract sensitive data from the database
   - Hint: Try using SQL comments and UNION statements

2. **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**
   - Location: Record access endpoints
   - Goal: Access records from other ministries
   - Hint: Look for predictable ID patterns

3. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
   - Location: Document upload functionality
   - Goal: Upload and execute malicious files
   - Hint: Check file type validation

4. **Command Injection**
   - Location: System command execution endpoints
   - Goal: Execute arbitrary system commands
   - Hint: Look for script execution points

5. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - Location: API responses and error messages
   - Goal: Find exposed sensitive information
   - Hint: Check response headers and error messages

6. **Authentication Bypass**
   - Location: Authentication endpoints
   - Goal: Access restricted resources
   - Hint: Look for token validation issues
