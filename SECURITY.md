## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of VulnGov seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to akintunero101@gmail.com.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

* Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

VulnGov follows the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).

## What to expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions.

## Recognition

If you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and we make a code or documentation change based on the issue, we will add you to the [Hall of Fame](HALL_OF_FAME.md) in our documentation.

## Safe Harbor

Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
